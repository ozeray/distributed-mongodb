How to build a replica set on Windows local machine:
1. Download Mongodb and add C:\Program Files\MongoDB\Server\7.0\bin to PATH
2. Download Mongosh and at its bin folder to PATH
3. Create three folders (for each Mongodb instance we'll use these folders for config, logs and data storage):
    D:\mongo\data1
    D:\mongo\data2
    D:\mongo\data3
4. Inside each folder create two folders: logs and config (Do this for each instance)
5. Inside each logs folder create an empty mongod.log file (Do this for each instance).
6. Inside each config folder create a mongod.cfg file with contents set for three instances accordingly. E.g.:
        storage:
          dbPath: D:\mongo\data1\db

        systemLog:
          destination: file
          logAppend: true
          path:  D:\mongo\data1\logs\mongod.log

        net:
          port: 27017
          bindIp: 127.0.0.1

    Change paths and ports for each instance.

7. Open a shell and run the first instance, which we'll set as primary:
     mongod.exe --dbpath "D:\mongo\data1" --logpath "D:\mongo\data1\logs\mongod.log" --port 27017 --storageEngine=wiredTiger --replSet repld

8. Open another shell and run mongosh --port 27017 to manage the instance.
9. When you run show dbs, there will be an error: MongoServerError: node is not in primary or recovering state
10. We'll assign it as a primary. Run the commands in order:
    rsconf={_id:"repld", members:[{_id:0, host:"localhost:27017"}]}
    rs.initiate(rsconf)

    Done. Our primary node is ready.

11. Now running show dbs will show all db's available in this instance.
12. Open a shell and run the second instance, which we'll set as secondary:
         mongod.exe --dbpath "D:\mongo\data2" --logpath "D:\mongo\data2\logs\mongod.log" --port 27018 --storageEngine=wiredTiger --replSet repld
13. Open a shell and run the third instance, which we'll set as secondary:
             mongod.exe --dbpath "D:\mongo\data3" --logpath "D:\mongo\data3\logs\mongod.log" --port 27018 --storageEngine=wiredTiger --replSet repld

14. Inside the shell we opened on step 8, run:
     rs.add("localhost:27018")
     rs.add("localhost:27019")

    Our secondary nodes are added into replica set.

15. Now you can run rs.help() to see options and various commands to see replica details:
        rs.status()
        rs.config()
        rs.hello()
        rs.isMaster()

16. Now insert some sample documents on primary node:
        use ecom
        db.test.insertOne({name:"Ahmet"})
        db.test.insertOne({name:"Mehmet"},{writeConcern:{w:1, wtimeout:5000}})
        db.test.insertOne({name:"Veli"},{writeConcern:"majority"})

        show dbs
        db.test.find() -> Will show our sample documents

17. Open another shell and run mongosh --port 27018.
        Inside the shell, run various commands to the status of our secondary node and verify the data is replicated:
         rs.isMaster()
         show dbs
         use ecom
         db.test.find() -> Will give error: MongoServerError: not primary and secondaryOk=false - consider using db.getMongo().setReadPref() or readPreference in the connection string
         db.test.find().readPref("secondary") -> Will give the sample documents
    Note: You can repeat this step for third node.

18. When you connect to localhost:27017 in Mongodb Compass, you'll see the following in Connection info menu:
        Stats
        4 DBs
        15 Collections

        Hosts
        localhost:27017
        localhost:27018
        localhost:27019

        Cluster
        Replica Set repld
        3 Nodes

        Edition
        MongoDB 7.0.1 Community

        :))

19. Now you can test whether leader election works or not:
        Kill the first instance and verify that the second instance becomes the primary.
